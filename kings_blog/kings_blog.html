      <h1>A Blog by King Wood-Lahm</h1>
      <h3>
        <em>King is a Yellow Labrador Retriever that lives in Portland, Oregon.
        He was adopted by Frank Lahm and Arla Wood in August of 2008 when he was 10 months old.
        He was living outside of Burns, Oregon in a very small, rural town.
        Since King moved in with Frank and Arla he has had a fun and loving life.
